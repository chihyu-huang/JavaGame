Welcome to the JavaGame project! This JavaFX game project implements the MVC pattern for a board-based (4X6) game with a start and finish line. Read the "javafxGame.pdf" file for detailed information about this project. You can also watch the demo video [here](https://youtu.be/_XtBZRbuPJU).

## Game Description

This game involves players navigating through a board to reach the finish line. Here's a brief overview:

- **Board Layout:** The game board is a 4X6 grid with a start and finish line.
- **Setup:** Choose the difficulty level and the number of players at the beginning. Assign names to each player.
- **Gameplay:** Players take turns to throw dice, determining their move (step and direction).
- **Objective:** The first player to reach the finish line wins. Low-scoring wins are recorded in the leaderboard.

### Rules
Here are some rules of the game:
1. Players can end their turn at any time.
2. Two 4-sided dice determine step and direction (50% forward, 25% backward, 25% freeze).
3. Players can turn right or left only if an obstacle or another player blocks the way.
4. Each step contributes one point to the score.
5. There are three types of obstacles, each with different penalties.

For detailed rules, refer to the provided documentation.
